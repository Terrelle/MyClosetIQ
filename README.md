# Virtual Fitting Room

This is a web application built with Flask that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the right clothing size for customers based on their body measurements. I built this as part of a Fashion Tech Hackathon.

Navigate to the project directory: cd virtual-fitting-room
Create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt


# Usage

Run the Flask application: python app.py
Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
Enter your body measurements in the input fields.
Click on the "Find my size" button to see your predicted clothing size.
